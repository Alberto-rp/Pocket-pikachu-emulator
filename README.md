# Pocket Pikachu Emulator

- This is a web project made by a huge fan of this 90'S old toy, "pocket pikachu" only with JS
- I'm trying to replicate it by reverse engineering, watching the behavior of mine and making it here.
- Still in progress, is not finished yet!
- Of course, this is a non-profit fan project, all rights to this content belong to its rightful creators.
